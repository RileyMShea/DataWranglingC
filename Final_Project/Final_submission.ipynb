    "## Problems Encountered in the Map\n",
    "After downloading the osm file of the Rochester area and running it against a provisional data.py file, I noticed five main problems with the data, which I will discuss in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inconsistent postal codes *(“1445033”, “14607-2082”, “14617-1822”)*\n",
    "- Over­abbreviated street names *(“S Tryon St Ste 105”)*\n",
    "- “Incorrect” postal codes (Charlotte area zip codes all begin with “282” however a large portion of all documented zip codes were outside this region.)\n",
    "- Second­ level `“k”` tags with the value `\"type\"`(which overwrites the element’s previously processed `node[“type”]field`).\n",
    "- Street names in second ­level `“k”` tags pulled from Tiger GPS data and divided into segments, in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```XML\n",
    "\t<tag k=\"tiger:name_base\" v=\"Stonewall\"/> \n",
    "\t<tag k=\"tiger:name_direction_prefix\" v=\"W\"/> \n",
    "\t<tag k=\"tiger:name_type\" v=\"St\"/>\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "### Over­abbreviated Street Names\n",
    "Once the data was imported to SQL, some basic querying revealed street name abbreviations and postal code inconsistencies. To deal with correcting street names, I opted not use regular expressions, and instead iterated over each word in an address, correcting them to their respective mappings in audit.py using the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def update(name, mapping): \n",
    "\twords = name.split()\n",
    "\tfor w in range(len(words)):\n",
    "\t\tif words[w] in mapping:\n",
    "\t\t\tif words[w­1].lower() not in ['suite', 'ste.', 'ste']: \n",
    "\t\t\t\t# For example, don't update 'Suite E' to 'Suite East'\n",
    "\t\t\t\twords[w] = mapping[words[w]] name = \" \".join(words)\n",
    "\treturn name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This updated all substrings in problematic address strings, such that:\n",
    "*“S Tryon St Ste 105”*\n",
    "becomes:\n",
    "*“South Tryon Street Suite 105”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Postal Codes\n",
    "Postal code strings posed a different sort of problem, forcing a decision to strip all leading and trailing characters before and after the main 5­digit zip code. This effectively dropped all leading state characters (as in “NC28226”) and 4­digit zip code extensions following a hyphen (“28226­0783”). This 5­digit restriction allows for more consistent queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, after standardizing inconsistent postal codes, some altogether “incorrect” (or perhaps misplaced?) postal codes surfaced when grouped together with this aggregator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count \n",
    "FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags \n",
    "\t  UNION ALL \n",
    "      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags\n",
    "WHERE tags.key='postcode'\n",
    "GROUP BY tags.value\n",
    "ORDER BY count DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the top ten results, beginning with the highest count:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "value|count\n",
    "28205|900\n",
    "28208|388\n",
    "28206|268\n",
    "28202|204\n",
    "28204|196\n",
    "28216|174\n",
    "28211|148\n",
    "28203|120\n",
    "28209|104\n",
    "28207|86\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " These results were taken before accounting for Tiger GPS zip codes residing in second­ level “k” tags. Considering the relatively few documents that included postal codes, of those, it appears that out of the top ten, seven aren’t even in Charlotte, as marked by a “#”. That struck me as surprisingly high to be a blatant error, and found that the number one postal code and all others starting with“297”lie in Rock Hill, SC. So, I performed another aggregation to verify a certain suspicion...\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These results confirmed my suspicion that this metro extract would perhaps be more aptly named “Metrolina” or the “Charlotte Metropolitan Area” for its inclusion of surrounding cities in the sprawl. More importantly, three documents need to have their trailing state abbreviations stripped. So, these postal codes aren’t “incorrect,” but simply unexpected. However, one final case proved otherwise.\n",

    " It turns out, *“280 North Old Woodward Avenue, 48009”* is in Birmingham, Michigan. All data in this document, including those not shown here, are internally consistent and verifiable, except for the latitude and longitude. These coordinates are indeed in Charlotte, NC. I’m not sure about the source of the error, but we can guess it was most likely sitting in front of a computer before this data entered the map. The document can be removed from the database easily enough.\n",

    "## Contributor statistics and gamification suggestion \n",
    "The contributions of users seems incredibly skewed, possibly due to automated versus manual map editing (the word “bot” appears in some usernames). Here are some user percentage statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top user contribution percentage (“jumbanho”) 52.92%\n",
    "- Combined top 2 users' contribution (“jumbanho” and “woodpeck_fixbot”) 83.87%\n",
    "- Combined Top 10 users contribution\n",
    "94.3%\n",
    "- Combined number of users making up only 1% of posts 287 (about 85% of all users)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about these user percentages, I’m reminded of “gamification” as a motivating force for contribution. In the context of the OpenStreetMap, if user data were more prominently displayed, perhaps others would take an initiative in submitting more edits to the map. And, if everyone sees that only a handful of power users are creating more than 90% a of given map, that might spur the creation of more efficient bots, especially if certain gamification elements were present, such as rewards, badges, or a leaderboard. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    " After this review of the data it’s obvious that the Charlotte area is incomplete, though I believe it has been well cleaned for the purposes of this exercise. It interests me to notice a fair amount of GPS data makes it into OpenStreetMap.org on account of users’ efforts, whether by scripting a map editing bot or otherwise. With a rough GPS data processor in place and working together with a more robust data processor similar to data.pyI think it would be possible to input a great amount of cleaned data to OpenStreetMap.org.\t"
